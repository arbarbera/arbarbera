Hello! Iâ€™m @arbarbera - Antonio ***Roberto Barbera*** - from Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.

I'm especially interested in Data Science for Capital Markets. I have been researching and participating in Financial Education and Portfolio Diversification projects, aimed at the variable income market in Brazil - B3 (.SA - Bovespa).

I am currently dedicated to the development of small applications, based on Python and Streamlit, some for educational purposes only, with the objective of helping Brazilian investors who are beginners discover the difference between price and value of assets. The purpose is to help them develop a long-term perception, allied to the individual historical risk view of each asset and its influence in building a diversified portfolio....
